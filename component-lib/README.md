# Streamlit Component Library

An npm package that provides support code for creating [Streamlit Components](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/components).

The fastest way to start writing a Streamlit Component is to use our [Component Template repo](https://github.com/streamlit/component-template), which contains templates and example code.
