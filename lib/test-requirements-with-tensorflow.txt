# 2021.12.07: Tensorflow is not installable on Python 3.10, so we
# only install it (and test against it) in Python 3.9 and earlier.
# Keras and Pytorch are dependent on Tensorflow, so they're also here.
#
# 2021.12.15: Additionally, pre-built tensorflow binaries do not
# currently include releases supporting Apple Silicon. Apple has a
# closed-source fork installable via conda, but it doesn't seem
# worth it to use that just to run a few tests locally.
